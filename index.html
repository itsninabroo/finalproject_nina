		<h1> About Me</h1>
		My name is Nina, I am a 22 years old. I am originally from New York but now live in Florida. My future career is making movies. I am currently going to UCF majoring in Film and Minoring in Digital Media. I have had a eye for filmmaking since I was a young girl. I taught myself how to use editing software at a young age. I decided to minor in Digital Media because I run a small online business and I think it is important for me to learn about Digital Media since my business is all online. My hobbies include, taking my dog out on adventures, Photography, and running my business.

		<p> For the social media interview I spoke with my boss about what her results were after looking through her facebook information. We found that the information was not too accurate becuase of the fact that she mostly used it for work purposes. Overall, it was interesting to see how facebook had access to what anyone is looking at and decides to show what ADs someone might be interested in. </p>

	<p>In my blog posts I talk about technology, fake videos and what should be talked about more often. This was the first time I have ever made a blog post so I learned a lot about the building of it. I did not realize how much time and effort went into making one. I am very familiar with people having blogs on a website called 'tumblr' however I never understood everything that a person needs to do to get it running properly until now. Attached is a link to my blog posts.

	<h1>Building a Website</h1>
<div class="columns-my">
  <p>You hear people who own businesses talk about paying someone else to build a website for their company. However, you never actually hear someone talk about how these websites get built. Their are a lot of rules to coding that one would never know until they are trying to learn it themselves. Throughout this course I think my favorite part was the Final which is building this website. Although, it took a lot of trial and error. It took multiple days to get it up and running and a lot of frustration. I am happy with the outcome of my website with the little knowlege I had about them.</p>
